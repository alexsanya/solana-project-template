## Overview

Your task is to implement a **Solana program** that includes basic operations for a **Merkle tree**. The program should support:

1. **Inserting a leaf node** into the Merkle tree.
2. **Emitting an event message** with the updated Merkle tree root after each insertion.

This assignment is designed to test your understanding of:

- Rust programming in the context of the Solana blockchain.
- Efficient state handling and serialization/deserialization.
- Hashing and binary tree concepts (Merkle tree).
- Solana-specific mechanisms for logging and events.
